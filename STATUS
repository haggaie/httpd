CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
    made in the trunk.

  * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
    get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
    branches/2.2.x, as applicable.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ start all new proposals below, under PATCHES PROPOSED. ]

  * mod_status: For long request lines we only see the front part of
    the requests in mod_status, which is useless if they only vary
    in their ending bits. Allow admin to specify whether they want
    to see the 1st 63 chars of the request, or the last.

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

  * mod_rewrite: Also set the Vary header if a rewrite condition is true and
    uses a HTTP header, but all remaining rewrite conditions are skipped due
    to the [OR] flag.

    +0: jim: I'm curious that if this would result in some
             "regressions" for some users who either depend on
             the old behavior or have worked around it...
        rpluem answers: If r574684 is backported (see below) these users can
        fix it without workarounds and a clear and promised behaviour.
        Relying on the above is relying on a buggy iundocumented behaviour,
        but yes I do this sometimes by myself :-).
    +1: jim: iff r574684 is also backported

  * mod_rewrite: Add the novary flag to RewriteCond in order to prevent
    the appending of HTTP headers used in a rewrite condition to the Vary
    header of the response.

   * mod_proxy: Support variable interpolation in reverse proxy configuration
     (revised proposal dealing with wrowe's concerns).

       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=421686  (code)

     2.2.x:
       http://people.apache.org/~niq/proxy-interp.patch
     rpluem says: Please add the documentation to your 2.2.x version of your
                  patch and a minor bump (changes to public mod_proxy.h) and
                  assume you are +1 to your own proposal.

  * mod_substitute: New module for on-the-fly response rewrite-like
    capability.
    trunk:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/trunk/modules/experimental/mod_substitute.c?view=log
       Don't even bother...

    rpluem says: If you add r602469
                 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=602469&view=rev) I am +1.

  * mod_autoindex: make spacing in HTML code the same as before r593816. This
        avoids that the autoindex test (t/modules/autoindex) fails. Adjusting
        the autoindex test would cause it to fail with older versions and would
        make it harder to recognize regressions.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

   * beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child_init hooks when
     entering ap_mpm_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap_mpm_run().
     Otherwise modules' child_init hooks appear to never be executed.
     Also, destroying pmain ensures that cleanups registered in modules'
     child_init hooks are performed (e.g., mod_log_config and mod_dbd).
