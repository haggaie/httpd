Contributors looking for a mission:

  * Just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" in the source.

  * Review the bug database at: http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/

  * Review the "PatchAvailable" bugs in the bug database:

    https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Apache+httpd-2&keywords=PatchAvailable

    After testing, you can append a comment saying "Reviewed and tested".

  * Open bugs in the bug database.


CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
    made in the trunk.

  * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
    get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
    branches/2.2.x, as applicable.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

* rpluem says: We need a new apr-util release to fix the regression discussed in
  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/200802.mbox/%3cPine.GSO.4.64.0802212127120.16348@kleopatra.acc.umu.se%3e
  (probably PR44538, definitely PR44648). The needed patch is already
  backported to apr-util 1.2.x
  (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=631559&view=rev).
  jim says: I am baselining shipping with apr-1.3; assuming we do, the
            above show-stopper would be moot.

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

   * mod_proxy: Support variable interpolation in reverse proxy configuration
     trunk:
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=421686  (code)
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=422178  (code)

     2.2.x:
       http://people.apache.org/~niq/proxy-interp.patch
     rpluem says: Please add the documentation to your 2.2.x version of your
                  patch and a minor bump (changes to public mod_proxy.h) and
                  assume you are +1 to your own proposal.
     niq says: I'll attend to that.  As regards vote, I'm +1 on the proposal,
               but -0 on including this as a new feature in 2.2.7.
               Better IMHO to separate releasing it from the many bugfixes
               in 2.2.7 mod_proxy.  Hence +1 for 2.2.8.
     +1: wrowe

   * mod_ssl: Add server name indication (RFC 4366) support (PR 34607).

      +1: fuankg
      +0: like ssl upgrade of 2.2, perhaps this is a good reason to bring
          httpd-2.4 to completion?  vhost changes could be disruptive to
          third party module authors.
      -1: rpluem: jorton found some problems with the trunk version and they
                  should be fixed / discussed in trunk before we backport.

   Backport version for 2.2.x of patch:
       Trunk version works
  +1: fielding, jim
  jim says: the use of atoi to generate the ?ID is
      consistent with what we do elsewhere but troubling...
      we need to find a better way to do this. In particular,
      ?ids cannot, iirc, be signed - this is more a note to
      self ;)
  Roy replies: the patch adds an id lookup and replaces the atoi id
      with the validated result.  Invalid input will now error out.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

   * beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child_init hooks when
     entering ap_mpm_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap_mpm_run().
     Otherwise modules' child_init hooks appear to never be executed.
     Also, destroying pmain ensures that cleanups registered in modules'
     child_init hooks are performed (e.g., mod_log_config and mod_dbd).
