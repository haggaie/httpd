Contributors looking for a mission:

  * Just do an egrep on "TODO" or "XXX" in the source.

  * Review the bug database at: http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/

  * Review the "PatchAvailable" bugs in the bug database:

    https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Apache+httpd-2&keywords=PatchAvailable

    After testing, you can append a comment saying "Reviewed and tested".

  * Open bugs in the bug database.


CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

  * Forward binary compatibility is expected of Apache 2.2.x releases, such
    that no MMN major number changes will occur.  Such changes can only be
    made in the trunk.

  * All commits to branches/2.2.x must be reflected in SVN trunk,
    as well, if they apply.  Logical progression is commit to trunk,
    get feedback and votes on list or in STATUS, then merge into
    branches/2.2.x, as applicable.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

* rpluem says: We need a new apr-util release to fix the regression discussed in
  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/200802.mbox/%3cPine.GSO.4.64.0802212127120.16348@kleopatra.acc.umu.se%3e
  (probably PR44538, definitely PR44648). The needed patch is already
  backported to apr-util 1.2.x
  (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=631559&view=rev).
  jim says: I am baselining shipping with apr-1.3; assuming we do, the
            above show-stopper would be moot.

      +1: fuankg
      +0: like ssl upgrade of 2.2, perhaps this is a good reason to bring
          httpd-2.4 to completion?  vhost changes could be disruptive to
          third party module authors.
      -1: rpluem: jorton found some problems with the trunk version and they
                  should be fixed / discussed in trunk before we backport.

   rpluem says: I am missing a minor bump and documentation.
   niq replies: Done.
   rpluem says: Thanks. Sorry for being picky, but after revisiting the patch
   again I ask myself how we can be sure that the chroot function is actually
   present on the platform we compile.

   rpluem: Good catch. Should be fixed by r660461.

   * scoreboard: Remove unused proxy load balancer elements from scoreboard
     image (not scoreboard memory itself).  Array of lb_score elements
     originally added in r104404 in manner akin to that used for
     worker_score.  Supporting code then removed in r105134 but scoreboard
     image size calculation left in place, likely by accident.

 * prefork: prefork's apr_pollset_poll() loop-on-EINTR loop was not checking
  die_now; the child holding the mutex will not die immediately if poll
  fails with EINTR, and will hence appear to "hang" until a new connection
  is recevied.

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED

   * beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child_init hooks when
     entering ap_mpm_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap_mpm_run().
     Otherwise modules' child_init hooks appear to never be executed.
     Also, destroying pmain ensures that cleanups registered in modules'
     child_init hooks are performed (e.g., mod_log_config and mod_dbd).
